The module is functionally correct, it finds the beginning or endings or the whole words in a sort of dictionary.

The programming style is, however, inconsistent and a bit confusing, as are the names of the subroutines.

Some parts look like copy-pasted from other sources. The function tagWord is unnecessarily exported.

The POD is not working at all. It is describing the function correctly, but an example would be nice.

The test is not a real test, but really only visual test, and not a good one, because the result is just a printed list of tags.

The test (the original one and my new one) are not covering the whole functionality, meaning that most of the dictionary is not covered by examples. I personally think it is not necessary.
